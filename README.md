# Coal-Thermanl-power-Plant-Digitization
Worked on a project of building digital twin of Coal based boiler digitization including entire process


** Asset efficiency** – Optimisation of the steam output based on the quantity of raw materials and temperature setpoints while analyzing the boiler, steam parameters, feed water, fuel feeder, FD Fan & ID Fan, heat losses, energy losses etc., to maximize the steam boilers’ efficiency.

The system set consists of Smart Connect IoT Gateways (Raspberry PI) & IO modules, sensors, WiFi routers and  Web based software 

A total of 9 sensors including Feed water flow, Steam Pressure, Steam Flow, Fuel feeder RPM etc. were enabled.

The Boiler Efficiency app consisted of dashboards and reports with the flexibility to deploy either on customers’ on-premise servers or as a cloud-based solution offering. It also includes a Digital Twin view of the plant and key boilers which enable Plant Managers to get a holistic view of the key parameters that need monitoring.
